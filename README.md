# SafeNet
Since women and people of the LGBTQ community are at higher risk when they go out on first dates, we wanted to create an app that checks in with the user by sending a safety check notification to the user's phone a designated number of hours/minutes after the date has started. From there, if the user didn't reply to the notification, verifying that they were safe, then the app would send a mass text message to designated contacts, informing the user's loved ones that they have not affirmed that they are safe yet. The hope of this app is to bring the necessary right of safety to communities that shouldn't believe that safety is a privilege.


This is the start of the code and database for the SafeNet app. There is no function yet due to lack of time as this was brainstormed during the HackTX 2022 Hackathon.
