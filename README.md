# SafeNet-Login
This is the code for the SafeNet app log in page. There is no function yet due to lack of time as this was brainstormed during the 
HackTX 2022 Hackathon. 

The SafeNet app is designed to protect women and people of the LGBTQ community as it provides a way to check if they are safe on their date
from a dating app. If they end up not indicating to the app that they are safe, the app will then notify designated contacts to indicate that
they are not safe.
